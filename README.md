# 2102HW5
HW5 for CS2102 Object Oriented Design

Overview

Our goal this week is to write clean, encapsulated code. You should aim to produce code that is well organized, uses helper methods and interfaces where appropriate, and follows good object-oriented design techniques. We will pay particular attention to these issues in grading your work.
This assignment is designed to help you think about where data and computations belong in a well-designed object-oriented program. Methods that produce the right answers--but aren't structured well--won't earn you many points. Figuring out where to put the various pieces of data--and what methods you need to create to work with the data--are part of the what you are being asked to figure out.

Although the assignment is described in two parts, you'll only be submitting the program for Part 2. However, we suggest you work through Part 1 as an initial implementation, then make the modifications described in Part 2.

Part 1: The Weather Monitoring Tool
Your overall goal in this part of the assignment is to provide a program that reports weather trends. To keep things simple, we are interested in two trends: average daily high temperature during a particular month, and average daily low temperature during a particular month. To this end, you need to create a WeatherMonitor class with (at least these) two methods:
averageHighForMonth, which takes a month (designated by a number such as 1 for January, 2 for February, etc) and a year and produces the average high temperature over all days that month.*
averageLowForMonth, which takes a month (designated by a number such as 1 for January, 2 for February, etc) and a year and produces the average low temperature over all days that month.*
The weather data you are tracking is initially gathered from a weather sensor. The sensor produces Readings containing the Time of the reading (hour and minute, both ints) and the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (use an int). Because the volume of readings is so high, your weather monitor will store only daily weather reports. A DailyWeatherReport contains the date (use the Java class GregorianCalendar, see description below) and two temperature readings: one for the lowest temperature of the day and one for the highest temperature of the day.
To manage the daily weather data, your WeatherMonitor must also provide a method addDailyReport that consumes a date and a list of readings (nominally for that date) and stores a daily report for the given date (computing the high and low temperature readings from the given list of readings for that date). For Part 1 of this assignment, the WeatherMonitor's daily reports should be stored in a LinkedList.

(* We won't actually require you to provide examples of daily weather reports for every single day in a month. Your calculations of averageHighForMonth and averageLowForMonth should produce the averages over all days in the month for which there are daily weather reports.)

Gregorian Calendar class
The date field for a daily weather report should be of type GregorianCalendar. This is a type available in the java.util library. Look at the Java API to learn how to use GregorianCalendar. Here are a couple of hints to get you started:
When constructing a date for a daily weather report, use this version of the GregorianCalendar constructor:

    public GregorianCalendar (int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)
To extract individual pieces of information from objects of type GregorianCalendar, use the get() method (inherited from the abstract Java class Calendar). Here's an example of how to extract the month:
    GregorianCalendar date = new GregorianCalendar(2016, 11, 17);
    int month = date.get(GregorianCalendar.MONTH);  // value of month will be 11
Part 2: Protecting and Encapsulating the Data
This set of exercises asks you to modify your code from Part 1 as needed to satisfy certain goals. Do not turn in separate code for these exercises: just modify your existing code from Part 1 as needed to meet these goals, then turn in the final (modified) version of your code.
Thinking ahead, you know that the weather monitor program should be able to support different data structures for the daily weather reports. Edit your code as needed to encapsulate the type of the daily weather reports from the overall WeatherMonitor class.

A WeatherMonitor constructor should take an interface type as its argument, and any fields that hold a DailyWeatherReport object should have an interface type.

A rogue hacker wants to modify the weather data in order to create a false panic about a pending natural disaster. The hacker has access to a WeatherMonitor object. Edit your code as needed to guarantee that the hacker cannot change any of the daily weather reports or their readings.

Something to think about: in Part 1 you were asked to define two methods, averageHighForMonth and averageLowForMonth. Presumably, the code you developed for these two methods looks pretty much the same, except that one calculates the average high and one calculates the average low. We've talked about why duplicating code is undesirable. Were you able to come up with a way to eliminate the duplicate code? For those of you who took CS 1101/1102, would you have handled the task of eliminating the duplicate code differently in Racket?
